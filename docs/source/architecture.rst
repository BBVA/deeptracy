Architecture
============



Components
----------

DeepTracy is composed of several components described in the following diagram:


.. blockdiag::
   :desctable:

    blockdiag {
        class component [color="white"];
        orientation = portrait;

        user [
            label="User",
            shape=actor,
            description="A system capable of requesting new vulnerability analysis and retrieving results"];

        deeptracy-server [

            description="Task orchestration through control API"];

        buildbot, deeptracy-server -> postgresql [label="Write"];
        deeptracy-server -> buildbot [label="Schedule"];

        user -> deeptracy-server [label="Control"];
        user -> hasura [label="Query"];
        deeptracy-server -> user [label="Feedback"];

        hasura -> postgresql [label="Read", style=dotted]; 
    }


Interactions
------------

The following activity diagram summarizes the normal interaction among the
components of the system.

.. note::

   This conceptual diagram describe the type of interactions but not how they
   are performed. In other words, this diagram does not describe if the
   interactions are synchronous nor asynchronous.


.. actdiag::
   :desctable:

    actdiag {
      requestscan -> schedule -> dependencyextraction -> dependencyscan ->
      reportdependencies -> schedulevulnerabilityscan ->
