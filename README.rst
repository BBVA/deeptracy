Deeptracy scans your project dependencies to spot vulnerabilities.

Is a meta tool to analyze the security issues in third party libraries used in
your project.

There are **many different tools for analyze third party vulnerabilities** for
many languages, **but there is not a unique tool that works well for all of
them**.

We have created **this project to simplify this process** and you can focus
only in the important: your project.

**Deeptracy** can choose the most suitable security tools for each languages
and notify the spotted vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.
