Deeptracy in a few words
========================

Is a meta tool to analyze the security Issues in third party libraries used in your project.

Why?
====

There're **many different tools for analyze third party vulnerabilities** for many languages, **but there're not a
unique tool that works well for all of them**.

This implies that:

1. you need to locate the language specific tool,
2. learn how use it,
3. transform the results format to one you understand

We've created **this project to simplify this process** and you can focus only in the important: your project.

**Deeptracy** can choose the most suitable security tools for each languages and notify the spotted vulnerabilities in
the project dependencies.
